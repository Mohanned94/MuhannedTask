Muhanned Task : Is the mobile challenge that I have to do it by android studio 

First  of all I want to tell that GitHub provider jobs api is deprecated from May 19, 2021
It will shut down entirely on August 19, 2021
So I work on one provider remotive.io: .

Second I use MVVM design pattern on the project A clean separation of different kinds of code should make it easier to go into one or several of those more granular and focused parts and make changes without worrying .

Third I use retrofit http request api It is very fast , It enables direct communication with the web service , It is easy to use and understand, It supports post requests and multipart uploads and many of advantages .

Fourth I use gson for parsing the json object 
The benefit you get with GSON is that object mapping can save the time spent writing code As for the implications on memory usage, you can use the fromJson() method call that takes a streaming JSONReader to minimize the String data that is kept in memory, failing which you can try to parse the json data using a JSONReader yourself.

Fifth in main view I have to shows the company logo if available unfortunately remotive.io provider does not have strings 
That retrieve logo so I insert default logo .

Finally on unit test I test the filter by location and position by typing number on search and expected result is Cannot get number on this fields .
